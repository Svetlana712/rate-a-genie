                        <div class="accordion-content">
                            <p>Requesting quotes on RATE A GENIE is easy. Simply post what you need to move, where it needs to go and when you need it done. This will then create
                                a listing on our site.</p><p></p><p>Listing items is completely free, and can be done in a matter of seconds. Feel free to list as many items
                            as you wish and rest assured that you are under NO obligation to accept any of the quotes you receive from transport providers.</p>

                        <div class="accordion-content">
                            <p>There are few ways in which you can increase the number of quotes you receive. Firstly, giving as much detail as possible about the item/s you are moving
                                will provide transport providers with a clearer idea of whether they have the correct vehicle to complete the job. Entering details such as weight and
                                dimensions, and an inventory for house moves, will all help you to receive more quotes.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, flexibility with dates will help increase
                            the number of quotes you receive and potentially encourage cheaper prices, as transport providers may be able to pick up your item as part of a route they are
                            already taking.</p><p></p><p>Inviting companies to quote will also help increase the number of quotes you receive as you may make your listing more visible to
                            appropriately matched transporters who hadn’t previously seen it.</p>

                            <p>To secure your chosen transport provider, you are required to pay a deposit to RATE A GENIE. This payment is only taken after you’ve accepted a quote from a transport provider. The deposit can be paid through our Secure Payment Gateway (which accepts all major credit and debit cards) or via PayPal.</p><p></p><p>We also accept card payments over the phone.</p><p></p><p>After paying the initial deposit to RATE A GENIE, you then pay the remaining balance directly to your chosen transport provider. Transport providers generally specify their accepted payment methods on their profiles; alternatively you can discuss this with them directly.</p><p></p><p>The amount you are quoted on RATE A GENIE, is the total amount you pay for the job. There are no hidden extras. Transport providers’ quotes are also all inclusive of all the services they offer.</p>

                            <p>RATE A GENIE is fully compatible with eBay and is also a member of the eBay developer’s programme. </p><p></p><p>To import an eBay auction item, simply enter the item number in the ‘Enter What Needs Moving’ field. We will then auto populate the related fields in the listing process (i.e. what the item is, its dimensions etc.)</p><p></p><p>You can request quotes for eBay items you are bidding on, interested in or have already won. If you don’t win the auction or no longer need the item transported, please be sure to remove the listing from the site to save transport providers’ time, quoting on items which no longer need moving.</p>

If listing an eBay item, simply tick the box ‘this is an eBay item’ and enter the eBay auction number below the sub-category and RATE A GENIE will do the rest.</p><p>•	Step 2: Enter item details and upload up to 10 images.</p><p>•	Step 3: Enter both the pickup and drop off details including dates you have in mind.</p><p>•	Step 4: If you would like to Upgrade your listing, enter a maximum price, enter a promo code or to receive SMS messages, please do so in Step 4</p><p>After the item is listed, all relevant Transport Providers who are interested in your listing will be alerted.</p><p>They are alerted because their preferences match your listing in one of the following ways:</p><p>1.	The nature your item being shipped (eg. a Yacht)</p><p>2.	Your location (e.g. Yarmouth)</p><p>3.	The destination of your item (e.g. Oban)</p><p>If you change your mind and decide not to have the listing shipped, please remove the listing as soon as possible, this then saves the TPs from making unnecessary bids.
