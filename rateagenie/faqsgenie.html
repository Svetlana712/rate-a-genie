                            <p>RATE A GENIE is a non-subscription based website. This means that it is totally free for all Transport Providers (TPs) to use until they have a bid accepted, at which time a minimal success fee is due.</p><p></p><p>Before you're able to bid, RATE A GENIE requires you to register by filling out our simple, step by step form (found at www.RATE A GENIE.com/sign-up). The moment you complete this registration your account will be active, giving you full access to RATE A GENIE's extensive search engine - where you'll be able to find potential jobs and start bidding on them.</p><p></p><p>There is one final step... RATE A GENIE requires all TPs to become verified, something that will give you long-term benefits.</p>

                            <p>RATE A GENIE has to verify your authenticity as a legitimate TP and until we can do this your profile will have an 'Unverified' status. Being 'Unverified' means that customers (those who wish to have something shipped) will not be able to tell how reliable you are, which could diminish your chances of having your bid accepted.</p><p></p><p>Once you’ve registered, we’ll send you a unique RATE A GENIE verification passkey to your registered address, which should take no more than 3 working days to arrive.
